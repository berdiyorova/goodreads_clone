        At the beginning of each calendar month, Goodreads’ crack editorial squad assembles a list of the hottest and most popular new books hitting shelves, actual and virtual. The list is generated by evaluating readers’ early reviews and tracking which titles are being added to Want to Read shelves by Goodreads regulars.
        Each month’s curated preview features new books from across the genre spectrum: contemporary fiction, historical fiction, mysteries and thrillers, sci-fi and fantasy, romance, horror, young adult, nonfiction, and more. Think of it as a literary smorgasbord. Check out whatever looks delicious.
        New in February: Native American author Tommy Orange documents generational trauma with his ambitious new novel, Wandering Stars. Kate Quinn and Janie Chang team up for historical fiction in San Francisco with The Phoenix Crown. And romance specialist Ali Hazelwood profiles a vampire in love with Bride.
        Also on tap this month: an urban fantasy heist story, a World War I ghost story, and a temporal twist on the Harlem Renaissance.
        Add the books that catch your eye to your Want to Read shelf, and let us know what you're reading and recommending in the comments section.
